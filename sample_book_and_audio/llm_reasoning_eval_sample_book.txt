Title: Shadows of Evergreen
Chapter 1: The Circle of Fireflies
Under the flickering lanterns of Evergreen’s autumn festival, six figures huddled near the old clocktower.
First was Remy Torres (they/them), the town’s 28-year-old apothecary whose scarred hands hinted at decades of work.
Beside them stood Wren, a sharp-tongued 17-year-old in a leather jacket, tossing a pocketknife impatiently.
"We’re wasting time," Wren muttered.
A raspy laugh cut through the silence.
Ms.Agatha "Aggie" Hale, the 72-year-old librarian, adjusted her shawl. "Patience, child. The Mayor will explain everything." 
The Mayor, a stout man in his late 50s with a salt-and-pepper beard, cleared his throat.
Mayor Gerald Fitz had ruled Evergreen for 15 years, but tonight, his voice trembled.
Nearby, Kai—a quiet, androgynous teen with dyed-blue hair—clutched a sketchbook.
Their foster parent, Dr.Eleanor Voss (45), placed a reassuring hand on Kai’s shoulder.
"Stay close," Eleanor whispered.
Suddenly, Captain, a three-legged golden retriever, barked at the woods.
"Easy, girl," said Jules, a farmer in muddy overalls. Jules’ age was hard to guess, but their crow’s feet suggested mid-40s.
Chapter 2: The Whispering Woods
Deep in the forest, the group split.
Wren and Kai stumbled upon a cottage where a hunched figure stirred a cauldron.
"Come in, dearies," croaked the figure—Granny Lila, though her youthful green eyes betrayed her 80-year-old frame.
"My grandson, Finn, should’ve greeted you," Granny sighed. "He’s 12 but acts 30." A giggle erupted from the rafters.
Finn, freckled and small for his age, waved cheekily.
Meanwhile, Remy and Jules found a cave etched with symbols.
"This matches the Professor’s notes," Remy said.
The Professor—a missing archeologist—was last seen at 39, but locals claimed he’d aged decades overnight.
Chapter 3: The Clocktower’s Secret
At dawn, Officer Rivera (they/them), a 33-year-old nonbinary detective, interrogated Mayor Fitz.
"You lied about the time capsule," Rivera snapped, slamming a 1985 photo of Fitz as a 10-year-old boy beside a woman who looked identical to Aggie.
Aggie paled."I...I was his nanny."
"Liar!" shouted Tabitha, a curly-haired barista."You’re his sister.You haven’t aged since 1970!"
